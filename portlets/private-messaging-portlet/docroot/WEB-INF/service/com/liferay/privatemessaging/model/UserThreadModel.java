 * The base model interface for the UserThread service. Represents a row in the &quot;PM_UserThread&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.

 * This interface and its corresponding implementation {@link com.liferay.privatemessaging.model.impl.UserThreadModelImpl} exist only as a container for the default property accessors generated by ServiceBuilder.
