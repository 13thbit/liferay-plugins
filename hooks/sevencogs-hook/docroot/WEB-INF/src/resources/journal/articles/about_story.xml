			Established in 2000, just when you thought that this world was done with cogs, gears and bearings one man dared to dream. Our founder, Jimony Tinkorer, otherwise known as Jimmy Tinky, has been thinking of the most creative ways to gear things. From a watch, transmission, and bicycle... to your computer, celphone, and his wife's hair curlers, he's done it all. Jimmy has always seeked to produce the most precise parts.

		<p>
			We've been producing the highest quality cogs, for a little over ten years. Our facilities are capable of manufacturing everything you need to build high torque, precision machines."Jimonyisms"

			"the wheel may turn, but can a wheel turn with slippery parts?"

		<blockquote>
			â€œWhy re-invent the cog?"

		<blockquote>
			"In this case and every other one like it, I would use a cog. Think about it."

		<blockquote>
			"The wheel makes the world go round, the cog powers the wheel.
